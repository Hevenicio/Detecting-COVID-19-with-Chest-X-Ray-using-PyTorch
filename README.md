## Project Description
In this project, PyTorch is used to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply it to a set of chest X-ray data. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. Our objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy. 

## Project Structure
**This project is divided into the following tasks:**

- Task 1: Introduction,
